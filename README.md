# Arch-Installer
My custom Arch Linux Instalator

You can configure it modifying the file config.json and executing automatic_install.py

to config the partitions after you need configure it with cfdisk or fdisk

if you want to omit the configuration options found in the "partitions" dict in config.json keep blank i.e. leave "/dev/" blank

There is not much more to say xd
