# Arch-Installer
My custom Arch Linux Instalator

### Configure

You can configure it modifying the file ```config.json``` and executing ```automatic_install.py```

To config the partitions after you need configure it with ```cfdisk``` or ```fdisk```

If you want to omit the configuration options found in the "partitions" dict in config.json keep blank i.e. leave "/dev/" blank

### Why python?

I use python for these scripts because python go by default in archiso, and I am better for python programming, also this process is very dangerous for the system and your pc

### Ending

There is not much more to say xd
