# Arch-Installer
My custom Arch Linux Instalator

You can configure it modifying the file config.json and executing automatic_install.py

to config the partitions after you need configure it with cfdisk or fdisk

if you want to omit the configuration options found in the "partitions" dict in config.json keep blank i.e. leave "/dev/" blank

I use python for these scripts because python go by default in archiso, and I am better for python programming, also this process is very dangerous for the system and your pc

There is not much more to say xd
